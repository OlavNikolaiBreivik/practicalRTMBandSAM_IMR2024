The Norwegian Spring Spawning herring assessment model:

The data consist of one catch fleet and three survey fleets. A plus group is assumed for the catch and two of the surveys. One survey is only for recruitment.

Separate fishing mortalities are assumed for ages 2–10, and a common fishing mortality is assumed for ages 9–12.

An AR1 structure is assumed within years for the fishing mortality increments.

Separate survey catchabilities are assumed for ages 2–8, and a common survey catchabilities are assumed for ages 9–12. No surveys share catchability parameters.

The variance of the increments in fishing mortality is assumed to be constant across all ages.

We assume a prediction-variance relationship, where a separate beta parameter is estimated for all fleets but is constant across ages. For catch data, separate alpha parameters are estimated for ages 2, 3, and 4–12. For Survey 2, separate alpha parameters are assumed for ages 3–4 and 5–12. For Fleet 4, separate alpha parameters are assumed for ages 3, 4, and 5–12.

An AR1 structure is assumed for observations within each relevant fleet.
